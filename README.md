# Surfs_Up_Challenge 

## Overview of the Analysis:
A statistical analysis of the Surf and Shake Shop that rents surfboards and serves ice cream in Oahu, Hawaii. The owner has requested temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results:

- June is on average 75F and at its max it's 85F. The minimum temperature of 64F is very tolerable in the evening. So overall the business should still do well during the day for surfing and ice cream.

- December's average temperature is 71F and the max temperature is 83F. The minimum temperature is 56F and that can be too cold for surfing if it drops that low during prime hours. Still, this wouldn't turn away all surfer's as long as they had wet-suits to keep warm. Ice cream will always sell as long as foot traffic is still up in the area regardless of temparture. However it could decline if there aren't enough surfer's coming to the area due to cold temped waters.

- 75% of the time the average temperature's in June, 77F, and December, 74F, are warm but possible not warm enough to keep the waters warm. Still a great time to visit Oahu, but visitor's may not be as tempted to go in the water since its not sweltering heat. Sales could definitely decline, but it's still possible to have customer's.


## Summary: 

- Based on previous analysis of the precipitation data Oahu receives very minimal amounts throughout the year. On average they receive .17 inches. Tourist's would very likely still visit the island based on the average temperature's are rain.

- Staying open based on weather data alone isn't smart. The owner's should also think about the foot traffic other business bring in nearby, and whether their location is easily accessible to visitors from resorts/hotels where they may stay. It's possible they do less business at that time because they don't advertise their services well, or are on the opposite side of the island to the majority of tourist activites.
